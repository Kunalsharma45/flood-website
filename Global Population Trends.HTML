    <p><font size="5">India has experienced significant population trends, including a steadily increasing population size over the years. While efforts to control population growth have shown some success, India remains one of the most populous countries globally. The population trends reflect a mix of factors, including improvements in healthcare leading to reduced mortality rates, increased life expectancy, urbanization, and various social and economic factors influencing birth rates.
<br><br>It took hundreds of thousands of years for the world population to grow to one billion – then in just another 200 years or so, it grew sevenfold. In 2011, the global population reached the seven billion mark, and in November 2022, it reached eight billion. This dramatic growth has been driven largely by increasing numbers of people surviving to reproductive age, and has been accompanied by major changes in fertility rates, increasing urbanization and large-scale migration. These trends will have far-reaching implications for generations to come. UNFPA is one of the world’s largest funders of population data collection and helps countries identify and understand such trends, which are critical to development. 
<br><br>The UN’s principal population projection (the medium variant) suggests that the world population will grow to nearly ten billion by the middle of this century, and will level off at around 10.4 billion by the 2080s. However, if fertility declines by less than projected, the world population could exceed twelve billion by the end of the century.
<br><br>Age distribution also affects whether populations expand or contract. Today, there are more adolescents and young people than ever before. As these youth age into parenthood, their strength in numbers will drive continued global population growth, despite falling fertility rates.
